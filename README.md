# Century 21 Kings County Housing Analysis

**Author**: Samuel Marder

## Overview

This is a project to understand the housing data provided by Kings County. Our exploration into the data will include an in depth analysis of modeling and regression.

## Business Understanding

Century 21 is looking to expand its footprint into a new market

## Data Understanding

* We have data from several recent sales of houses including when the house built, sqft of the lot and of the living space

## Modeling

* We are trying to predict a price via factors such as a housing score, floors, and other features
* One feature we are using is the product of grade and the log transform of sqft living space 


## Regression Results

* Based on these findings, I suggest renovating an older house to have more living space and a higher overall quality (leading to a higher housing score in the model)

## Conclusion

* I would expand on a house with a high grade while maintaining or improving that grade
