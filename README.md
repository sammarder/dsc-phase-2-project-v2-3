# Century 21 Kings County Housing Analysis

**Author**: Samuel Marder

## Overview

This is a project to understand the housing data provided by Kings County. Our exploration into the data will include an in depth analysis of modeling and regression.

## Business Understanding

Century 21 is looking to expand its footprint into a new market

## Data Understanding

* We have data from several recent sales of houses including when the house built, sqft of the lot and of the living space
* This data is suitable for regression because we have multiple features that could be useful to a model such as year built, waterfront view, and more

## Modeling

* I choose to use only sqft living and grade because of their high coorelation to the price

## Regression Results

* The regression result is that we want a high grade and high sqft living as those are most highly coorelated with price

## Conclusion

* I would expand on a house with a high grade while maintaining or improving that grade
